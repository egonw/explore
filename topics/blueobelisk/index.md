The internet has brought together in 2005 a group of chemists, programmers, informaticians who are driven by wanting to do things better, but are
frustrated with the Closed systems that chemists currently have to work with. They share a belief in the concepts of Open Data, Open Standards,
and Open Source (ODOSOS) (but not necessarily Open Access). And they express this in code, data, algorithms, specifications, tutorials,
demonstrations, articles and anything that helps get the message across.
